# Horiseon-HW-2023

With hours spent over reading and combing the archives of code language and definitions, I was able to push on and get this done!  

  

Within this challenge I modified the header to properly separate it from the other main bodies of code. 

  

I added the nav element 

  

Created proper sections for the three divs with images and links. Along with that adding alt attributes to img lines of code. 

  

I layered the H1s to H4s in order of headings. 

  

I simplified and organized the CSS sheet while fixing any class or id modifications.  

  

Added comments to the CSS style sheet. 

  

Fixed the link issue on the nav bar to the first section. 

  

Lastly, I added a proper web title. 

  

With all that done we have our new version of Horiseon!
